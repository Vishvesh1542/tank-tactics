# Tank Tactics

## How to Play

- The main board is a 10x10 grid.
- Each player is assigned a starting spot.
- Players can move or blast, but both actions require energy.
- Energy is distributed to all players at regular intervals (usually once a day).
- Players can also trade energy to form alliances against opponents.
- The last person standing wins!
