# tank-tactics
This is a fun game which will soon be on discord. It is kind of like a board game.

# How to play # 
- The main board is a 10* 10 grid.
- All players are assigned a spot.
- From that spot, players can move, or blast.
- But both of these require energy.
- Energy is given to all the players in regular time intervals (usually 1 day)
- Players can also trade energy to team up against someone.
- Last person standing wins!
- This calls for a lot of strategy, teaming but at the end, only one person wins!
